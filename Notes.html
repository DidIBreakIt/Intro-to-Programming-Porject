            - A collection of HTML documents, links between the HTML documents create its web-like nature.<br>
            - It contains a wide array of files, including plain text, images, audio, and video.<br>

          <div class="item">
            - It is made up of text content, markup (what it looks like), references to other documents (i.e. videos, images), and links to other pages.

          <div class="item">
            - Made up of tags, in the format of &ltname&gtcontents&lt/name&gt.<br>
            - The opening tag, contents, and closing tag, as a whole, are refered to as an element.<br>
            - The b tag makes the contents appear bold.<br>
            - The em tag makes the contents appear in italics.<br>
            - Forgetting to write in the closing tag can lead to disasterous results because the computer does not know inherently where the closing tag should be.<br>
            - Not all tags require a closing tag, such as &ltbr&gt and &ltimg&gt. In those instances, the closing tag is referred to as a void tag.

            - Written in the format &lttag attribute = "value"&gtcontents&lt/tag&gt.<br>
            - Tags can have multiple attributes.<br>
            - An exampe of a tag that uses an attribuite is the anchor tag, &lta href = "url"&gtcontent&lt/a&gt. Anchors are for making links.<br>
            - Another example is the image tag, which is written out as &ltimg src = "url" alt = "text"&gt (there is no closing tag). The src is the address of where the image is located, and the alt is the text that gets displayed when the image does not load.

            - If you enter text on multiple lines, it is still rendered in HTML as one line.<br>
            - The break tag, &ltbr&gt, creates a line break.  It is a void tag.<br>
            - The paragraph tag, &ltp&gtcontent&lt/p&gt, also creates a break by making a block around its contents.

            - Block tag creates an invisible box around its contents.  The box can have height and width.<br>
            - Examples of block elements include &ltp&gt.

        <div class="item">
          <p>- HTML helps design the structure of the page.  CSS determines the style of the page.  Java lets users interact with the page.</p>
          <p>- Every HTML page has a branching, tree-like structure, otherwise known as the DOM(<em>Document Object Model</em>).</p>
          <p>- HTML classifies page content.</p>
          <p>- CSS changes how elements look on the page.</p>
          <p>- Every element on an HTML page is a rectangle.  CSS allows other shapes to be displayed on the page.</p>
          <p>- The page is actually like a grid, and boxes can placed and rearranged on the grid.</p>

            - They can be used in their own assignment statement, i.e. days = days - 1.<br>
            - In programming, the equals symbol means assignment not equivalency.<br>
            - Convention says that variables should start with a lower case letter.

            - The character, in a certain position of a string, can be evaluated by the expression: &ltstring&gt[&ltexpression&gt], where the expression in the brackets evaluates to a number.<br>
            - I.e. 'udacity'[0]='u' or 'udacity'[1+1]='a'<br>

            - I.e. 'udacity'[1:4]='dac' or 'udacity'[2:-2]='aci'<br>
            - Leaving the right side open will return a subsequence from the first number to the end of the string, i.e. 'udacity'[3:]='city'.<br>
            - Leaving the left side open with return a subsequence from the beginning of the string til the number on the left minus 1, i.e. 'udacity'[:4]='udac'.<br>
            - Leaving both sides open will return the entire string.
